# Directory Deployment

This repository contains the deployment manifests for AGNTCY Directory project and serves as the **federation registry** for the public staging network. It is designed to be used with Argo CD for GitOps-style continuous deployment.

The manifests are organized into two main sections:
- `projects/`: Contains Argo CD project definitions.
- `projectapps/`: Contains Argo CD application definitions.

The project will deploy the following components:
- `applications/dir` - AGNTCY Directory server with storage backend (v1.3.0)
- `applications/oidc-gateway` - optional standalone OIDC/SPIFFE gateway for external `dirctl` / SDK / automation access (v1.0.0)
- `applications/spire*` - SPIRE stack for identity and federation (with SPIFFE CSI driver)

**NOTE**: This is not a production-ready deployment. It is
provided as-is for demonstration and testing purposes.

**Latest Version**: v1.3.0 - See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new.

## Getting Started

Choose your path based on your goal:

### 📍 I want to use Directory (connect to public staging)

**Goal:** Connect your application to the existing Directory network to discover agents.

**Prerequisites:** You'll need a SPIRE server in your environment.

**Next Step:** Follow the [Client Onboarding Guide](onboarding/README.md)

---

### 🚀 I want to deploy my own Directory instance

**Goal:** Run your own Directory instance for local testing or private deployment.

**Prerequisites:** Kubernetes cluster (Kind, Minikube, or cloud provider)

**Next Step:** See [Getting Started](https://docs.agntcy.org/dir/getting-started/) (Helm or GitOps/Argo CD)

---

### 🌐 I want to deploy AND join the public network

**Goal:** Run your own Directory instance and federate with the public staging network.

**Prerequisites:** Kubernetes cluster + SPIRE knowledge

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy your Directory instance (see [Getting Started](https://docs.agntcy.org/dir/getting-started/))
2. Setup federation (see [Client Onboarding Guide](onboarding/README.md) after deployment)

As of `dir` `v1.3.0`, the Helm chart provides a default DHT bootstrap address for the public testbed. In most cases you should leave bootstrap-peer settings unset in your values unless you intentionally need to override that default.

## Optional OIDC/SPIFFE Authentication Gateway

The default Directory deployment in this repository uses SPIFFE/SPIRE-oriented authentication that works well for in-cluster workloads. If you also want to support `dirctl`, SDKs, or automation running **outside** the cluster, deploy the standalone `oidc-gateway` application alongside `dir`.

The public gateway chart lives in the dedicated repository:

- [agntcy/oidc-gateway](https://github.com/agntcy/oidc-gateway)

This gateway puts Envoy in front of Directory:

1. A remote client presents an OIDC JWT, SPIFFE JWT-SVID, or SPIFFE X.509-SVID.
2. Envoy validates bearer JWTs with `jwt_authn` or downstream SPIFFE mTLS when enabled.
3. The ext-authz service normalizes the caller to a canonical principal and checks allowed gRPC methods.
4. Only authorized requests are forwarded to the internal Directory apiserver with the configured principal header.

### When to Use It

Use the OIDC gateway when:

- You want remote `dirctl` access from a laptop or workstation outside the cluster
- You want a human login flow backed by Dex
- You want GitHub Actions or other external automation to call Directory with OIDC tokens

You do not need this gateway if you only use in-cluster, SPIFFE-based access.

### What to Configure

The staging example now includes a separate `oidc-gateway` app under `applications/oidc-gateway/dev/`. The main settings are:

- `envoy.backend.*`: points Envoy at the internal Directory service
- `envoy.oidc.issuers[]`: configures Envoy `jwt_authn` providers and JWKS lookup for bearer-token validation
- `envoy.oidc.github.*`: configures GitHub Actions OIDC for automation
- `authServer.oidc.issuers`: maps verified token issuers to stable provider keys such as `dex` or `github`
- `authServer.oidc.headers.authPrincipal`: sets the canonical principal header forwarded to Directory (`x-auth-principal` by default)
- `authServer.oidc.roles`: maps canonical principals such as `oidc:dex:alice`, `oidc:github:repo:...`, or `spiffe:spiffe://...` to allowed gRPC methods
- `ingress.*`: exposes the Envoy gateway for external access over gRPC

### Dex and Remote Clients

If you want interactive user login, configure Dex in `applications/dex/dev/values.yaml` and make sure:

- `config.issuer` matches the public URL where Dex is reachable
- your GitHub OAuth app credentials are supplied through a Kubernetes Secret
- the Dex issuer values in `applications/dex/dev/values.yaml` and `applications/oidc-gateway/dev/values.yaml` match

Enabling Dex by itself is not enough for remote Directory access. Remote clients also need the standalone `oidc-gateway` deployed so their OIDC tokens can be validated before requests reach Directory.

### Canonical Field Reference

The staging values file is a user-facing example. For the complete public source of truth for all supported fields, see:

- `agntcy/dir/install/charts/dir/values.yaml`
- `agntcy/oidc-gateway/install/charts/oidc-gateway/values.yaml`

## Next Steps: Connecting to the Directory Network

After deploying your Directory instance (see [Getting Started](https://docs.agntcy.org/dir/getting-started/)), it will be **isolated** and cannot discover agents from other organizations.

### Why Join the Network?

**Current State (Standalone):**
- ✅ Your Directory works for your organization
- ❌ Cannot discover agents from other organizations
- ❌ Your agents are not discoverable by others
- ❌ Limited to your own trust domain

**After Federation:**
- ✅ All standalone benefits
- ✅ Discover agents across multiple organizations
- ✅ Your agents become globally discoverable
- ✅ Part of decentralized discovery network

### How to Setup Federation

Federation requires configuring SPIRE to exchange trust bundles with other Directory instances.

**Follow these steps:**

1. **Choose a Federation Profile**
   - **https_web** (recommended): Uses standard HTTPS + Let's Encrypt, no SSL passthrough needed
   - **https_spiffe**: Uses SPIFFE mTLS, requires SSL passthrough and bootstrap bundle exchange
   
   See [Federation Profiles](https://docs.agntcy.org/dir/federation-profiles/) for detailed comparison.

2. **Create Your Federation File**
   - Describes how others can connect to your SPIRE federation endpoint
   - Template: `onboarding/federation/.federation.web.template.yaml` (or `.federation.spiffe.template.yaml`)
   - Example: See `onboarding/federation/spire.ads.outshift.io.yaml` for reference

3. **Submit Your Federation File**
   - Fork this repository
   - Add your file to `onboarding/federation/your-domain.com.yaml`
   - Submit a Pull Request

4. **Deploy Directory's Federation File**
   - After approval, deploy `onboarding/federation/spire.ads.outshift.io.yaml` to your cluster
   - Run `task gen:dir` to regenerate `applications/dir/gen.values.yaml`
   - ArgoCD will automatically sync the federation configuration
   - This tells your SPIRE how to connect to the Directory network

**Complete Instructions:** See the [Client Onboarding Guide](onboarding/README.md) for step-by-step federation setup.
